<Introduction>
  In the business world, the risk of failing to meet financial obligations is
  inevitable. In Indonesia, two main legal instruments govern debt settlement
  when debtors face financial difficulties: Bankruptcy and Suspension of Payment
  (PKPU). Both mechanisms are regulated under Law No. 37 of 2004 concerning
  Bankruptcy and Suspension of Payment (Bankruptcy and PKPU Law). This article
  will discuss the concepts, processes, differences, and legal implications of
  both instruments.
</Introduction>

## Bankruptcy

Bankruptcy is a situation where a debtor (individual or legal entity) is declared unable to pay their debts to creditors. Bankruptcy status is established through a court decision (Commercial Court) and aims to settle debts fairly through liquidation of debtor's assets or debt restructuring.

### Objectives of Bankruptcy

- Protect creditors' rights to obtain debt payment.
- Provide opportunities for debtors to settle debts in a structured manner.
- Prevent unilateral actions by creditors in collecting debts.

### Bankruptcy Process

Filing a Petition: A bankruptcy petition can be filed by the debtor themselves or creditors with a minimum debt of IDR 1 billion.
Bankruptcy Decision: The Commercial Court will examine the petition and decide whether the debtor meets the requirements to be declared bankrupt.
Appointment of Curator: If declared bankrupt, the court appoints a curator (asset manager) to manage and sell the debtor's assets.
Claim Verification: Creditors must register their debt claims with the curator for verification.
Liquidation or Restructuring: The debtor's assets are liquidated to pay debts, or a peace plan (accord) is made if possible.

## PKPU (Suspension of Payment)

PKPU is a legal effort to temporarily suspend the debtor's debt payment obligations, to provide an opportunity for debt restructuring negotiations with creditors without going through the liquidation process. PKPU is preventive in nature and aims to avoid bankruptcy.

### Objectives of PKPU

- Give time to debtors to plan debt settlement.
- Avoid asset liquidation that harms debtors and creditors.
- Encourage debt settlement through mutual agreement (accord).

### PKPU Process

- **Filing a Petition:** Can be filed by debtor or creditor with minimum debt of IDR 1 billion.
- **Temporary PKPU Determination:** Commercial Court can grant temporary payment suspension (45 days) to facilitate negotiations.
- **Creditors Meeting:** Debtor must submit peace plan (accord) to creditors in meeting attended by minimum 50% creditors.
- **Accord Approval:** If approved by majority of creditors (minimum 2/3 of debt amount), court will ratify accord.
- **Accord Implementation:** If accord fails, debtor can be declared bankrupt.

## Legal Implications

- **Bankruptcy:**
  - Debtor loses right to manage assets.
  - Creditors must register debt claims through curator.
  - "Stay of execution" occurs against individual creditor claims.
- **PKPU:**
  - Debtor maintains asset control, but under administrator (curator) supervision.
  - During PKPU, creditors are prohibited from unilateral collection.
  - If accord is approved, debtor must fulfill payment agreement.

## Legal Framework and Recent Developments

The Bankruptcy and PKPU Law has undergone several changes, including through Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 2 of 2022 aimed at post-pandemic economic recovery. This regulation expands PKPU space by easing filing requirements and extending negotiation periods. On the other hand, bankruptcy filing requirements by creditors are tightened to prevent abuse.

## Conclusion

Bankruptcy and PKPU are two sides of the same coin in resolving debt disputes in Indonesia. Bankruptcy focuses more on liquidation, while PKPU offers a peaceful path through restructuring. Understanding both instruments is important for business actors to mitigate financial risks and determine appropriate legal strategies when facing financial difficulties. With recent regulatory developments, PKPU is increasingly optimized as a preventive solution that prioritizes fairness principles for debtors and creditors.
